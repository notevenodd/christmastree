I found this fun xmas tree from https://github.com/rpulid/christmastree
on 2015-12-15. The code was quite rough, so I rewrote it. Functionally,
it remains the same... except it's much faster.

Original script I forked from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpulid/christmastree/a764bfa6685694d96b37f308b54fffd9146139ec/christmastree.sh
